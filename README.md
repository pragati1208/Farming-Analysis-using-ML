# Farming-Analysis-using-ML
The "Farming Analysis Using ML" project addresses agricultural challenges by integrating IoT devices (NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11, Soil Moisture Sensor) with machine learning models (RNN, CNN, Softmax). It provides real-time insights into soil conditions, humidity, and temperature for smart irrigation and disease detection.
